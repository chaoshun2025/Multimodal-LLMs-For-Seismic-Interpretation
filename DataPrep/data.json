The fold geometry reveals a syncline on the left and an anticline on the right, indicating earlier compressional deformation. The left and central blocks are downthrown relative to the rightmost block, reflecting subsequent extensional faulting. An angular unconformity truncates the faulted and folded strata at the top. The entire sequence—including the faults, folds, and unconformity—is tilted and dipping to the left, suggesting later regional tilting following deformation and erosion.",

The pre-faulting layers display a syncline on the left and an anticline on the right, indicating prior compressional deformation. The central block is downthrown relative to the adjacent blocks, forming a graben structure consistent with extensional tectonics. An angular unconformity truncates the faulted and folded strata at the top. The entire sequence, including the unconformity, is gently tilted to the left, suggesting a later phase of regional tectonic tilting.",
